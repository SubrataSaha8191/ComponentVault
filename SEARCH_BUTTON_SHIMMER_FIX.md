# Search Button & Shimmer Animation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Double Glow Effect on Search Button
**Problem**: The search button had a double glow effect on hover - one from the parent group container and one from its own hover state, creating an overly bright and distracting visual effect.

**Solution**: Removed the hover shadow effect from the button itself while keeping the parent container's glow effect.

**Changed in**: `app/page.tsx`
- Removed `hover:shadow-xl hover:shadow-amber-500/40` from the Search button
- The button now only inherits the parent group's hover glow effect, eliminating the double glow

### 2. Awkward Shimmer Animation
**Problem**: The background shimmer effect used fixed pixel values (`-1000px` to `1000px`) and a 2-second animation, causing it to start and stop abruptly in the middle of the screen, creating an awkward, jerky user experience.

**Solution**: Redesigned the shimmer animation to be smooth, continuous, and slow:

**Changed in**: `app/globals.css`

#### Keyframe Animation Update:
```css
/* Before */
@keyframes shimmer {
  0% {
    background-position: -1000px 0;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 1000px 0;
  }
}

/* After */
@keyframes shimmer {
  0% {
    background-position: -200% 0;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 200% 0;
  }
}
```

#### Animation Class Update:
```css
/* Before */
.animate-shimmer {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent 0%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 50%, transparent 100%);
  background-size: 1000px 100%;
  animation: shimmer 2s infinite;
}

/* After */
.animate-shimmer {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, transparent 0%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 50%, transparent 100%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: shimmer 8s linear infinite;
}
```

#### Key Improvements:
- **Percentage-based positioning**: Uses `-200%` to `200%` instead of fixed pixels, making it responsive and smooth
- **Slower animation**: Increased from 2s to 8s for a more subtle, elegant effect
- **Linear timing**: Ensures constant speed throughout the animation cycle
- **Proper background sizing**: Set to `200% 100%` to work seamlessly with the percentage-based positions

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Cleaner Search Button**: The search button now has a single, elegant glow effect that doesn't overwhelm the user
2. **Smooth Shimmer**: The background shimmer now flows continuously and slowly across the hero section, adding sophistication without distraction
3. **Premium Feel**: Both fixes enhance the luxury aesthetic of the ComponentVault landing page

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3001`
2. Observe the hero section background shimmer - should flow smoothly and continuously
3. Hover over the search button - should have a single, elegant glow effect (not doubled)

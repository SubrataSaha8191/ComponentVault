# Profile Page Dynamic Implementation

## Overview
Converted the profile page from static mock data to fully dynamic rendering with real-time data from Firestore. All sections now display actual user stats, components, activities, achievements, and community metrics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server APIs Created

#### `/api/profile` - User Profile & Stats
**Purpose**: Fetch authenticated user's profile data and calculated statistics
**Method**: GET
**Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)
**Response**:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "uid": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "displayName": "string",
    "photoURL": "string",
    "bio": "string",
    "website": "string",
    "github": "string",
    "twitter": "string",
    "location": "string",
    "createdAt": "timestamp"
  },
  "stats": {
    "components": 48,
    "downloads": 125340,
    "favorites": 1847,
    "views": 89234,
    "followers": 2847,
    "following": 342
  }
}
```

**Stats Calculation**:
- `components`: Count of user's components
- `downloads`: Sum of all downloads/copies across user's components
- `views`: Sum of all views across user's components
- `favorites`: Count of times user's components have been favorited
- `followers`: Count of users following this user
- `following`: Count of users this user is following

#### `/api/profile/components` - User's Components
**Purpose**: Fetch user's recent components
**Method**: GET
**Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)
**Query Parameters**:
- `limit` (optional, default: 10): Number of components to fetch

**Response**:
```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "thumbnail": "string",
      "downloads": 0,
      "favorites": 0,
      "views": 0,
      "category": "string",
      "framework": "string",
      "createdAt": "timestamp",
      "isPublic": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `/api/profile/activity` - User Activity Feed
**Purpose**: Fetch user's recent activities
**Method**: GET
**Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)
**Query Parameters**:
- `limit` (optional, default: 20): Number of activities to fetch

**Response**:
```json
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "type": "view|copy|download|favorite|unfavorite",
      "text": "Viewed Component Name",
      "description": "Viewed Component Name",
      "componentId": "string",
      "createdAt": "timestamp",
      "date": "2 hours ago"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Time Formatting**:
- < 60 seconds: "Just now"
- < 60 minutes: "X minutes ago"
- < 24 hours: "X hours ago"
- < 7 days: "X days ago"
- < 30 days: "X weeks ago"
- Older: Full date

#### `/api/profile/achievements` - User Achievements
**Purpose**: Calculate and return earned achievements based on user stats
**Method**: GET
**Authentication**: Required (Bearer token)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "achievements": [
    {
      "id": "early_adopter",
      "name": "Early Adopter",
      "description": "Joined in the first month",
      "icon": "Award",
      "color": "text-purple-500"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Achievement Definitions**:
1. **Early Adopter**: User has been a member for at least 1 month
2. **First Component**: Published at least 1 component
3. **Popular Creator**: Reached 1,000+ downloads
4. **Top Contributor**: Published 10+ components
5. **Community Favorite**: Received 100+ favorites
6. **Trending Creator**: Reached 10,000+ views
7. **Influencer**: Gained 100+ followers
8. **Prolific Creator**: Published 25+ components

### 2. Profile Page Updates (`app/profile/page.tsx`)

#### State Management
```typescript
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
const [profileData, setProfileData] = useState<ProfileData | null>(null)
const [components, setComponents] = useState<ComponentData[]>([])
const [activities, setActivities] = useState<ActivityData[]>([])
const [achievements, setAchievements] = useState<AchievementData[]>([])
const [loadingComponents, setLoadingComponents] = useState(false)
const [loadingActivities, setLoadingActivities] = useState(false)
```

#### Data Fetching
- **Profile & Stats**: Fetched on component mount when user is authenticated
- **Achievements**: Fetched on component mount
- **Components**: Fetched on mount (limit: 5 recent components)
- **Activities**: Fetched on mount (limit: 10 recent activities)

#### Dynamic Sections

**1. Profile Header**
- User display name, email, photo from authenticated user or fetched profile
- Bio displayed dynamically or default placeholder
- Location, website, social links shown only if available
- Join date from user metadata or profile data

**2. Stats Cards**
- Components count
- Total downloads
- Total favorites
- Total views
- All stats show loading state, then real numbers

**3. Recent Components Tab**
- Shows loading state while fetching
- Empty state with "Upload Your First Component" CTA
- Component cards with:
  - Thumbnail image
  - Name/title
  - Download, favorite, and view counts
  - Link to component detail page
- "View All Components" button links to `/my-components`

**4. Activity Tab**
- Shows loading state while fetching
- Empty state with "No recent activity" message
- Activity items showing:
  - Activity description
  - Relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
  - Activity icon

**5. Achievements Sidebar**
- Dynamic icon mapping from string to Lucide icon component
- Shows earned achievements only
- Empty state: "No achievements yet. Keep creating!"
- Hover shows achievement description (title attribute)

**6. Community Stats**
- Followers count (dynamic)
- Following count (dynamic)
- Progress bars scaled to show relative progress

### 3. Security & Authorization

All profile API endpoints require authentication:
```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization')
if (!authHeader?.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}

const idToken = authHeader.split('Bearer ')[1]
const decodedToken = await adminAuth.verifyIdToken(idToken)
const userId = decodedToken.uid
```

- Uses Firebase ID token verification
- Admin SDK bypasses Firestore security rules
- Only authenticated users can access their own profile data

### 4. Error Handling

**Client-Side**:
- Toast notifications for API errors
- Loading states for async operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

**Server-Side**:
- Try-catch blocks around all async operations
- Detailed error logging with console.error
- 500 status with error messages for failures
- 404 status for missing resources
- 401 status for unauthorized access

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Static mock data
- Fake numbers (48 components, 125,340 downloads)
- Hardcoded achievements
- Mock components and activities

### After
- Real-time data from Firestore
- Accurate statistics calculated from actual data
- Earned achievements based on real metrics
- User's actual components and activities
- Loading states for better UX
- Empty states with helpful CTAs
- Links to actual component pages
- Social links only shown if configured

## Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel Fetching**: Profile stats use Promise.all for concurrent queries
2. **Limited Queries**: Components and activities have configurable limits
3. **Index Requirements**: Queries may require composite indexes in Firestore
4. **Lazy Loading**: Components and activities fetched separately from profile
5. **Caching**: Consider adding client-side caching for profile data

## Required Firestore Indexes

The following composite indexes may be required:

1. **Components by Author & Creation Date**:
   - Collection: `components`
   - Fields: `authorId` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)

2. **Activities by User & Creation Date**:
   - Collection: `userActivities`
   - Fields: `userId` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)

3. **Follows by Following**:
   - Collection: `follows`
   - Fields: `followingId` (Ascending)

4. **Follows by Follower**:
   - Collection: `follows`
   - Fields: `followerId` (Ascending)

4. **Avatar Upload**: Allow users to upload custom profile pictures
5. **Achievement Progress**: Show progress bars for locked achievements
6. **Activity Filtering**: Filter activities by type (upload, favorite, etc.)
7. **Component Filtering**: Filter components by category, framework, etc.
8. **Share Profile**: Generate shareable profile links
9. **Download Stats Graph**: Visualize download trends over time
10. **Follower List**: View and manage followers/following

## Notes

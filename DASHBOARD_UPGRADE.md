# Dashboard UI Upgrade & Footer Optimization

## Overview
Upgraded the dashboard and all pages with a modern luxury design theme while optimizing footer placement to appear only on the landing page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Footer Optimization
**Problem**: Footer was appearing on all pages, creating visual clutter on internal pages like dashboard, browse, collections, etc.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `<Footer />` from `app/layout.tsx` (global layout)
- Added `<Footer />` component import and usage directly in `app/page.tsx` (landing page only)
- Footer now appears only on the landing page, keeping other pages clean and focused

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed Footer import and component
- `app/page.tsx` - Added Footer import and component at the end

### 2. Dashboard UI Upgrade

#### Design Theme: **Luxury White-Gold Dark Mode**
Inspired by the landing page's premium aesthetic, featuring:
- Dark slate background (slate-950 → slate-900 → black gradient)
- Amber/yellow gold accents
- Premium glass morphism effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Floating gradient orbs
- Enhanced hover states with glow effects

#### Specific Enhancements:

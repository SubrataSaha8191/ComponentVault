# Favorites API 500 Error Fix

## Problem
Dashboard was throwing a 500 error when fetching user favorites:
```
Error: Failed to fetch favorites: 500
    at getUserFavorites (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./app/dashboard/page.tsx:180:19)
```

## Root Cause
The `/api/favorites` GET endpoint was returning raw `Favorite` objects from the database, which only contain:
- `userId`
- `componentId` 
- `createdAt`

However, the dashboard expected an array of full `Component` objects with all component details (title, description, thumbnail, etc.).

## Solution
Updated `/app/api/favorites/route.ts` to:

1. **Fetch favorite records** - Get the user's favorites (which contain component IDs)
2. **Resolve component data** - For each favorite, fetch the full component details using `getComponentById()`
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - If a component was deleted or can't be loaded, filter it out instead of crashing
4. **Return full components** - Send back complete component objects that the dashboard can display

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
// Get all user favorites
const favorites = await getUserFavorites(userId);
return NextResponse.json(favorites);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Get all user favorites
const favorites = await getUserFavorites(userId);

// Fetch full component data for each favorite
const componentsPromises = favorites.map(async (favorite) => {
  try {
    const component = await getComponentById(favorite.componentId);
    return component;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Failed to fetch component ${favorite.componentId}:`, err);
    return null;
  }
});

const components = await Promise.all(componentsPromises);
// Filter out any null values (components that failed to load or were deleted)
const validComponents = components.filter(c => c !== null);

return NextResponse.json(validComponents);
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent API behavior** - Now matches what the dashboard expects
2. **Error resilience** - Handles deleted components gracefully without breaking the entire favorites list
3. **Complete data** - Dashboard receives all component information needed for display
4. **No breaking changes** - Existing functionality for checking if a specific component is favorited remains unchanged

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Dashboard favorites tab loads without 500 errors
- [ ] Favorites display with correct component information
- [ ] Deleted components are handled gracefully (don't crash the list)
- [ ] "Add to Favorites" still works
- [ ] "Remove from Favorites" still works
